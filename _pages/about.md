Hey there! I am **Arnav Sareen**, a second-year student at UNC Charlotte majoring in both Computer Science (with a concentration in AI, Robotics, and Gaming) and Data Science, with a minor in statistics. Thank you so much for checking out my webpage!

I am passionate about learning new things and hopefully one day leveraging the things I can learn to help others. That's why I decided to pick technology as my career focus: it has an unprecedented ability to impact the lives of countless people in a way no other innovation quite has. 

In my free time, I love watching sports (Go Patriots!), playing video games and taking walks around the many gorgeous places in UNC Charlotte's campus, and the surrounding North Carolina landscape. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
