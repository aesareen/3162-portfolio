I am <strong>Arnav Sareen</strong>, a second-year <a href="https://levinescholars.charlotte.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Levine Scholar</a> at UNC Charlotte majoring in both Computer Science (with a concentration in AI, Robotics, and Gaming) and Data Science, with a minor in statistics. Thank you so much for checking out my webpage!</p> <p>I am passionate about learning new things and hopefully one day leveraging the things I can learn to help others. That’s why I decided to pick technology as my career focus: it has an unprecedented ability to impact the lives of countless people in a way no other innovation quite has.</p> <p>In my free time, I love watching sports (Go Patriots!), playing video games and taking walks around the many gorgeous places in UNC Charlotte’s campus, and the surrounding North Carolina landscape.</p> </body></html>
